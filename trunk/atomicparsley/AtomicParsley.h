/*
v0.1   10/05/2005 Parsing of atoms; intial Tree printout; extraction of all "covr.data" atoms out to files
v0.2   11/10/2005 AtomicInfo.NextAtomNumber introduced to facilitate dynamic atom tree reorganization; CreateSparseAtom added
v0.5   11/22/2005 Writes artist properly of variable lengths properly into an iTMS m4p file properly (other files don't fare well due to the stsd atom non-standard nature); a number of code-uglifying workarounds were employed to get get that far;
v0.6   11/25/2005 Added genre string/numerical support, support for genre's dual-atom ©gen/gnre nature, genre string->integer; bug fixes to APar_LocateAtomInsertionPoint when an atom is missing; APar_CreateSparseAtom for ordinary non-data atoms are now type -1 (which means they aren't of any interest to us besides length & name); implemnted the Integer data class; char4short; verified iTunes standard genres only go up to "Hard Rock"; added jpg/png artwork embedding into "covr" atoms; slight bugfix for APar_FindAtom (created spurious trailing "covr" atoms).
v0.6    GPL'ed at sourceforge.net
v0.65   11/25/2005  bugfixes to newly introduced bugs in APar_FindAtom; metaEnema to remove all metadata (safe even for m4p drm files); year implemented properly (tagtime moved onto non-standard 'tdtg' atom ala id3v2.4 - because I like that tag); added setting compilation "cpil" tag (an annoying 5byte tag); added advisory setting (maybe it'll give me a kick one cold winter day-do a "Get Info" in iTunes & in the main "Summary" tab view will be a new little icon next to artwork)
v0.7    11/26/2005 added a writeBack flag to for a less beta-like future; integrated NSImage resizing of artwork; environmental preferences for artwork modifications; build system mods for Mac-specific compiling; 
v0.7.1  11/27/2005 modified parsing & writing to support Apple Lossless (alac) mp4 files. The lovely "alac.alac" non-standard atoms (parents & carry data) caused unplayable files to be written. Only QT ISMA files get screwed now (no idea about Nero)
v0.7.2  11/29/2005 creates iTunes-required meta.hdlr; all the tags now get spit back when reading them (--textdata); slight fix to how atoms are parsed; all known m4a files now tag properly: iTunes (m4a, m4b, chapterized, alac), Quicktime (ISMA & mpeg4 - change filename ext to .m4a to see art; all QT products require the meta.hdlr addition), faac, Helix Producer & Nero; slight change to how PrintDataAtoms called FindParentAtom; added tag time on "©ed1" (edit date-might only really belong directly under udta); added "©url" to hold url; fixes to APar_RemoveAtom; added cli ability to remove all artwork
v0.7.3  12/02/2005 handles stsd (and child) atoms better; modifies all stco offsets when needed (not just the first); new oddball iTMS video "drmi" atom handling; new "stik" atom support (sets iTunes GetInfo->options:Movie,TV Show, Music Video); writes iTMS video drm TV shows well now; diffs in a hex editor are moov atom length, and then into stco, so all is well
v0.7.4  12/03/2005 "desc", "tvnn", "tvsh", "tven" & "tves" setting
v0.7.5b 12/09/2005 forced 'mdat' into being childless (chapterized mpeg4 files have atoms scattered througout mdat, but they aren't children); fixed issues with ffmpeg created mpeg4 files (that have mdat as 2nd atom; moov & chilren as last atoms); moved ffmpeg mdat atoms around to end; better atom adding at the end; subbed getopt_long_only to getopt_long for pre-10.4 users; added progressbar
v0.7.5c 12/10/2005 funnguy0's linux patches (thanks so much for that)
v0.7.5d 12/11/2005 endian issues for x86 mostly resolved; setting genre's segfaults; stik doesn't get set in a multi-option command, but does as a single atom setting; Debian port added to binaries (compiled under debian-31r0a-i386 with g++4.02-2, libc6_2.3.5-8 & libstdc++6_4.0.2-2) - under VirtualPC - with the nano editor!
v0.7.5e 12/16/2005 ammends how atoms are added at the end of the hierarchy (notably this affects ffmpeg video files); writes "keyw", "catg", "pcst", "aART" atoms; read-only "purl" & "egid" added
v0.7.6  12/31/2005 ceased flawed null-termination (which was implemented more in my mind) of text 'data' atoms; UTF-8 output on Mac OS X & Linux - comment in DUSE_ICONV_CONVERSION in the build file to test it other platforms (maybe my win98Se isn't utf8 aware?); cygwin build accommodations; fix to the secondary "of" number for track/disk on non-PPC; implemented user-defined completely sanctioned 'uuid' atoms to hold.... anything (text only for now); "--tagtime", "--url" & "--information" now get set onto uuid atoms; allow creation of uuid atoms directly from the cli; cygwin-win98SE port added to binary releases; added '--freefree' to remove any&all 'free' atoms
v0.8    01/14/2006 switched over to uint8_t for former ADC_CPIL_TMPO & former ADC_Integer; added podcast stik setting & purl/egid; bugfixes to APar_RemoveAtom; bugfixes & optimizations to APar_FindAtom; changes to text output & set values for stik atom; increase in buffer size; limit non-uuid strings to 255bytes; fixed retreats in progress bar; added purd atom; support mdat.length=0 atom (length=1/64-bit isn't supported; I'll somehow cope with a < 4GB file); switch from long to uint32_t; better x86 bitshifting; added swtich to prevent moving mdat atoms (possible PSP requires mdat before moov); universal binary for Mac OS X release; no text limit on lyrics tag
v0.8x   0?/0?/2006 fixed an imaging bug from preferences; fixed metaEnema screwing up the meta atom (APar_RemoveAtom bugfix to remove a direct_find atom); added --output, --overWrite; added --metaDump to dump ONLY metadata tags to a file; versioning for cvs builds; limited support for 64-bit mdat atoms (limited to a little less than a 32-bit atom; > 4GB); bugfixes to APar_RemoveAtom for removing uuid atoms or non-existing atoms & to delete all artwork, then add in 1 command ("--artwork REMOVE_ALL --artwork /path --artwork /path"); support 64-bit co64 atom; support MacOSX-style type/creator codes for tempfiles that end in ".mp4" (no need to change extn to ".m4v"/".m4a" anymore); moved purl/egid onto AtomicDataClass_UInteger (0x00 instead of 0x15) to mirror Apple's change on these tags; start incorporating Brian's Win32 fixes (if you malloc, memset is sure to follow; fopen); give the 'name' atom for '---' internal iTunes tags for metadata printouts; allow --freefree remove 'free's up to a certain level (preserves iTunes padding); squash some memory leaks; change how CreateSparseAtom was matching atoms to accommodate EliminateAtom-ed atoms (facilitates the previous artwork amendments)
